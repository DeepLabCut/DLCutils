This repository contains various scripts as well as links to other packages related to [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut). Feel free to contribute your own analysis methods, and perhaps some short notebook of how to use it. Thanks!


# Example scripts for scaling up your DLC analysis & training:

These two scripts illustrate how to train, test, and analyze videos for multiple projects automatically (scale_raining_and_evaluation.py) and how to analyze videos that are organized in subfolders automatically (scale_analysis_oversubfolders.py). Feel free to adjust them for your needs!

# Using your DLC outputs, loading, simple ROI analysis, visualization examples:

## Time spent of a body part in a particular region of interest (ROI)

You can compute time spent in particular ROIs in frames. This demo Jupyer Notebook shows you how to load the outputs of DLC and perform the analysis (plus other plotting functions):

## Linear Transformation and Scaling of DLC output data (transform_and_scale)

This package is designed for anyone who wants to know where a tracked marker is within a reference frame (i.e. behavioral context). DeepLabCut outputs coordinates in relation to the field of view of the recorded video. With this tool, these coordinates can be linearly transformed and scaled to the reference frame of the behavioral context, meaning that the output coordinates are distances [cm] to a corner of the behavioral context, instead of distances [px] to a corner of the video field of view.

## 3D reconstruction with EasyWand/Argus DLT system with DeepLabCut data:

Written by [Brandon Jackson](https://github.com/haliaetus13), post our DLC workshop in Jan 2020: 

A small set of utilities that allow conversion between the data storage formats of DeepLabCut (DLC) and one of the DLT-based 3D tracking systems: either Ty Hedrick's DigitizingTools in MATLAB, or the Python-based Argus. These functions should allow you to use data previously digitized in a DLT system to create the files needed to train a DLC model, and to import DLC-tracked points back into a DLT 3D calibration to reconstruct 3D points.

## LEGACY utility functions (no longer required in DLC 2+):

## DLC1 to DLC 2 conversion code

This code allows you to import the labeled data from DLC 1 to DLC 2 projects. Note, it is not streamlined and should be used with care.

## Running project created on Windows on Colaboratory
#UPDATE: as of Deeplabcut 2.0.4 onwards you no longer need to use this code! You can simply create the training set on the cloud and it will automatically convert your project for you.

   - This solves a path problem when creating a project and annotating data on Windows (see https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/issues/172). This functionality will be included in
a later version of DLC 2 (DONE!)
https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DLCutils/tree/master/conversion_scripts_LEGACY

*Usage:* change in lines 70 and 71 of https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DLCutils/tree/master/conversion_scripts_LEGACY/convertWin2Unix.py

```basepath='/content/drive/My Drive/DeepLabCut/examples/'```

```projectname='Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30'```

then run this script on colaboratory after uploading your labeled data to the drive. Thereby it will be converted
to unix format, then create a training set (with deeplabcut) and proceed as usual...
